# 🏁 Mini Hackathons – Dashboard

This repository is part of my **weekly / bi-weekly mini-hackathon challenge** where I build small, complete projects to push my learning in:

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- UI/UX layout and component structure
- Real-world frontend patterns

The goal is simple:  
**Build fast. Learn deeply. Ship often.**

## 🎯 Purpose

Each mini hackathon focuses on:

- Designing a real interface (not toy examples)
- Structuring components cleanly
- Practicing layout, state, and visuals
- Improving speed and confidence through repetition

This Dashboard project is one of those iterations.

## 🧱 Current Features

- Glassmorphism sidebar layout
- Gradient background system
- Responsive structure (desktop & mobile aware)
- Component-based architecture (App, Sidebar, etc.)
- Tailwind utility-first styling
- Icon integration (Lucide)

---

## 🛠️ Tech (implicitly used)

- React (with Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Modern ES Modules
- Component-driven UI

(I keep the stack minimal and focused for learning speed.)
