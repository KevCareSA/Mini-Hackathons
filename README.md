# 🏁 Mini Hackathons

This repository is a collection of my personal **mini hackathon projects**.

The goal is to:

- Build real projects regularly (weekly / bi-weekly)
- Learn by solving real problems
- Practice finishing projects, not just starting them
- Track my growth publicly on GitHub

Each mini hackathon is a time-boxed project with:

- A clear problem to solve
- Requirements and constraints
- Design and thinking process
- Implementation
- Reflection and lessons learned

## 📂 Structure

Each hackathon will live in its own folder:

```text
mini-hackathons/

├── 01-DashBoard/
├── 02-.../
├── 03-.../
└── ...

```
